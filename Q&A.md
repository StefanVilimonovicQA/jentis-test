3. Integration Points: Ensures seamless interaction between components.
  

**Q3. Approach to Testing Each Area:**

  

**API Endpoints:**

  

- Use tools like Postman or RestAssured for API testing.

- Create test cases for each endpoint to verify correct behavior (CRUD operations).

- Validate response codes, data integrity, and error handling.

**GUI Components**
  

- Use  Cypress for UI testing.

- Create test cases for all user interactions and workflows.

- Validate input forms, error messages, and data displays.

- Conduct usability testing to ensure intuitive design.

**Integration Points:**

  

- Perform end-to-end testing to verify the entire flow from GUI to API and back.

- Use tools like Postman Collections for automated integration testing.

- Ensure data consistency and proper handling of API responses by the GUI.
